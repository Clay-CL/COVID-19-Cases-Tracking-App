# COVID19Tracker
This is an App which makes use of [The Covid Tracking Project's API](https://covidtracking.com/) to display the Daily Increase of Corona Virus Cases in the US,
Nationwide and State-wise. 

Originally it was taught by Rahul Pandey Sir, (check out his youtube tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7NYbSE8uaBB1EiPYScD66ZVWyu6cOyrR))

This app makes use of MVVM architecture and the Retrofit Library to make API calls.

The clean architecture of the app was inspired by the [MVVM news App](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQkwcJG4YTCRF8XiCRESq1IFFW8COlxYJ) 
by [AndroidDevs](https://github.com/androiddevs18/MVVMNewsApp)
